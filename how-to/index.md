# How to

The following sections contain how to guides for the team.

## Change or introduce new processes

We are always working to improve our team's processes. This how to contains
information about how to propose and document changes to our processes.

Everyone on the team should be attending a retro for each pulse. For more
information, see [Pulse Retro](../delivery-workflows/pulses/pulse-retro.md).
This is a great opportunity to raise any issues or suggestions for changes to
our processes.

For minor changes/ clarifications to processes, just raise a PR on our team
documentation. For major changes, such as introducing a new process or making a
significant change to an existing process, please write a new spec or update an
existing spec. This process spec should go through our usual review process.
Once the spec has been approved, the team documentation should be updated to
reflect the new or changed process.
