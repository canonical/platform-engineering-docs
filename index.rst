Platform Engineering Team
==================================

The Platform Engineering team (formerly IS DevOps) is responsible for building, transitioning and maintaining operations-specific charms in line with the latest charming standards. 
We have 3 teams with folks from Americas, EMEA and APAC and are responsible for products like Indico, Github runners, Jenkins, Wordpress, Discourse, 12-factor charms and many more!

For a full list of charms we are responsible for, see the `Charm Engineering Releases <https://releases.juju.is/?team=IS>`_ page.
