Guidance on adding an architecture diagram
==========================================

Justification for why: Part of 25.04 roadmap, link automated objectives spreadsheet 

This document offers guidance on how to create and add an architecture item to the docs so that we can remain as consistent as possible between our charms.

For the purposes of the agreement item, we will be focusing on charm (application) architecture diagrams, how the charm works internally. Later we can focus on reference architecture, how the charm works in the context of other integrated charms.

Where: In Explanation, under "Charm architecture"

How: Use Mermaid. Explain what Mermaid is. Maybe link the C4 model diagram website here. 

List examples of Mermaid diagrams currently in docs (including Maubot). 
Maybe copy the Maubot diagram into these docs?
Then show the raw code as well?

Benefits of Mermaid: Renders in GitHub, RTD, and Discourse.
