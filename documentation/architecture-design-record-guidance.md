# Guidance on adding an architecture design record

An Architecture Design Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important
architectural decision made in the development of an application or system.
It records the context, the decision, the reasoning behind it, and
any consequences. ADRs help teams track and communicate the evolution of a
system’s architecture over time.

## How to create an ADR

To create an ADR:

1. Use the Google Docs template titled "[Template] Architecture Design Record: Charm."
2. Create a new document based on this template.
3. Save the document in the "Platform Engineering / Charms / [Charm Name]"
 Google Drive folder.
4. Name the document as "Architecture Design Record: [Charm Name]"

[Charm Name] is the name of the charm (e.g. Synapse).

## How to keep the ADR updated

- Regularly review the ADRs as part of your project’s documentation updates.
- Update existing ADRs if the context or decisions evolve over time.
- The Decisions section provides a table with the columns: Date, Environment,
Description, and Reference.
- Keep the description short and written in a way that people from different
teams can understand.
- As a reference, you can add specifications, Discourse posts, Mattermost
threads, or any other resources that add context on how the decision was made.
