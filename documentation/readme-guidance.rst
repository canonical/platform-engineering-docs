Guidance on writing READMEs
===========================

Point of a README, justify why it's documentation

If you create a new charm using the is-charms-template-repo, then you'll have a template (link) available to fill in.

For pre-existing charms that do not use the template, update 

context on template (documentation practice for in-progress spec on charm documentation guidelines)

Provide some guidance on special situations (e.g. mono-repo projects with multiple directories)

Provide a list of examples
