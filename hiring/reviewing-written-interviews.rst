Reviewing written interviews
============================

When reviewing a written interview, you are looking for a candidate's ability to
communicate well and suitability for the role. Written communication is
important for us since, as a remote company, a lot of our communication is
through written mediums like specs, tickets, mattermost etc., so it's critical
for us to judge how well someone is able to express their thoughts in writing.
It's not important for someone to have a wide vocabulary as long as their
responses are clear and understandable. Keep in mind that many candidates don’t
have English as their first language.

We are also looking for motivation. An indicator of that could be the effort put
into the submission. When you are judging the interviews look for:

1. Evidence of exception achievements (e.g., during education, in their hobbies,
  in their jobs)
1. Any open source contributions
1. Why they want to join Canonical
1. Skills they have and technologies they are familiar with (we use Python,
  linux, k8s, GitHub actions, …)

Evidence of Exceptional Achievement
-----------------------------------

Evidence of exceptional achievement is both explicitly asked for in the
scorecard and should influence the final grade. The following are examples of
exceptional achievement to help calibrate the grading:

* Winning science olympiads during school
* High grades at the end of their school or during university
* On the Dean’s list
* Certifications and industry awards
* Speaking at conferences
* Creating open source projects that are widely used
* Promotions in their career

Scorecard Grading
-----------------

* *Strong Yes*: Great academic results (top 10% of class, published papers,
  frequent promotions), familiarity with most of our technologies (Python,
  Linux, k8s), strong motivation to join Canonical, clear communication,
  complete submission covering most of the questions asked
* *Yes*: Good academic results (top 20%) , familiarity with Python and linux
  (K8s, openstack, LXD etc. are good to have), motivation to join Canonical,
  good communication, >60% complete submission
* *No Decision*: Try avoiding this if possible. Only use it if you don't believe
  the candidate is a good fit for this role but could be a better fit for
  another team. In other cases, if you are undecided, it is probably a no.
* *No*: Incomprehensible responses, incomplete submissions, no experience with
  any of the technologies we use, lack of motivation ("Want to join Canonical
  because its an open source company", “want to work from home”)
* *Definitely Not*: One word responses, submitting resumes as take home or
  answering "see my resume/cv", only submitting questions, AI generated/
  generic/ copied responses, totally wrong profession, derogatory remarks or
  questionable opinions ("I don't believe in diversity"), admit to cheating on
  exams, …

Attribute Rating
----------------

If a candidate does not have an attribute, e.g. Docker and k8s, put a No on the
attribute, e.g. 'Relevant technical domains', and leave a note. If they have a
good take home other than that and could be a fit for the company, they can
still receive a yes grade.

Notes
-----

* Canonical expects written interview reviews to be completed within 2 working
  days of you receiving them with a preference for sooner than that. One way
  could be to complete your written interviews as the first thing you do in the
  morning.
* Don’t research the candidate too much
* Don’t follow links to personal websites or GitHub accounts as this will
  potentially bias your decision. The written interview should be graded purely
  based on the content of the interview.
* Spend about 20-30 minutes per written interview. Deeper reviews will be done
  later.
* For the attributes, leave out anything that there is no evidence of or not
  discussed
* For follow ups, can put a note in for other interviewers in the public field
