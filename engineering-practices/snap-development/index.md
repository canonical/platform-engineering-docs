# Snap development

## Publication

The Snap Store does not currently propose "team ownership" for published snaps.

To ensure maintenance continuity, all snaps published by the team should be
shared with "platform-engineering@lists.canonical.com". To do so:

1. Go to your snaps: https://snapcraft.io/snaps
2. Click on the snap name.
3. Go to Settings and then "Manage collaborators in dashboard.snapcraft.io".
4. Add "platform-engineering@lists.canonical.com" and click "Share with these people".
