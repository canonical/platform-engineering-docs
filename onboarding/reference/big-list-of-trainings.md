# The Big List of Training
**Source: [Discourse](https://discourse.canonical.com/t/the-big-list-of-trainings/3781/2)**

Here is a (about to be) big list of training I've enjoyed. These are books, videos and courses, as well as some sites that offer programming challenges. I've tried linking to the official websites and you can usually find most of the books on O'Reilly and other providers.

This list is not extensive and hopefully it will grow through collaboration.

Enjoy

_hint_ There is also the recommendation section in [PR002](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BYyMZhvUjl7KyBwzmjnk7RI_NmVAlMIz5HrQoLMubn8/edit) - some items overlap, some do not (and some topics I don't cover).

## Computers general

This is basically about "how computers work".

[From NAND to Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/)

That is a great hands-on exercise that takes you from NAND gates to building a computer on which you can run Tetris.  Super fun!

[CODE](https://codehiddenlanguage.com/)

The book covers a lot, lots of historical moments, how computers came to be, how they evolved.

[OSTEP](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)

The comet book, this one is great about understanding the major pieces behind operating systems.

## Go

Golang materials.

[Learn Go with tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/)

This is a hands-on approach towards learning Golang and is really fun, as the feedback is instant - you "fix" a thing, the test passes, you move on.

[Learning Go in 2024](https://www.bytesizego.com/blog/learning-golang-2024)

Keeping things meta, this is an up to date list of resources, so I don't have to copy paste items here.

## Python

Python materials.

[Python Distilled](https://www.dabeaz.com/python-distilled/)

That one is packed, think "Language X: the Good Parts" kind of thing. Nice when you have experience with other languages and want to ramp up quickly. Works great as a refresher as well.

[Python testing with `pytest`](https://pythontest.com/)

Good to get you up to speed with testing, very approachable book.

## Linux

How Linux works.

[The Linux Programming Interface](https://man7.org/tlpi/)

That one is a pure gem, lots of materials, though every page is worth the read.

## Programming

Programming in general.

[SICP](https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/index.html)


The wizard book - it is about programming and offers interesting paradigms. You also learn about LISP, though that is not the only thing in this book. A classic.

On software design, Domain Driven Design is an old pearl.

On something practical, from Google, both the Site Reliability Engineering, a classic and Software Engineering at Google are quite good. Of this last one I like the chapters about testing. There is another book about testing that I havenâ€™t read (yet).

## Coding challenges

Some good sites that let you test and expand your programming skills.

[Exercism](https://exercism.org/)

Exercism has great challenges in many languages and a lot of live tutors you can request help from. In recent time they started adding yearly challenges and post different ways of solving a problem on their YouTube page. You can also look at how other people solved a problem and learn some interesting techniques.

[project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)

This one has been around for a long time and has mathematical problems that get progressively harder. It is interesting when you apply your programming language to a mathematical problem and the actual math is often very interesting as well.

[AoC](https://adventofcode.com/)

I love that one - the Advent of Code has been there for several years now and it is "held" every December. Every year there is a story around which the problems revolve. All years are archived and you can have a go at previous years.  There is a good community on Reddit and you can even find categorized problems and other people's solutions if/when you get stuck. Nice to solve the same problem in a couple of languages.

## Networking

All things networking.


[Computer Networking: A Top Down Approach](https://gaia.cs.umass.edu/kurose_ross/eighth.php)

This is also a classic, currently in the eighth revision, it covers all the technical aspects you will need and then some.

[UNIX Network Programming](http://www.unpbook.com/)

Considered one of the best books on network programming, though it might be a bit too much in terms of content.

[Network Programming with Go](https://nostarch.com/networkprogrammingwithgo)

This is a great book, it implements a lot of networking concepts in short, testable snippets. What I really liked is the approach the author took of writing almost everything in Go tests.

## Kubernetes

K8s is gr8.

[Kubernetes the Hard Way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way)

Kelsey Hightower's guide, gets you building your own cluster and do a lot of things manually that usually happen behind the scenes (certs creation, `auth` for various K8s components..)

[Mumshad Mannambeth](https://www.udemy.com/user/mumshad-mannambeth/)

Mumshad has two great courses on CKA and CKAD that come with a great lab environment to practice, the topics are presented short and clear.

[killer.sh](https://killer.sh/)

Kim Wuestkamp's site, a lab practice for CKA/CKAD/CKS that should be harder than the actual exam - it is now part of the official certification, so you get one lab try free with every cert exam purchase. The courses as well are great. Only remark I had was he uses backspace in vim when deleting content and that's just not my kind of thing.

## Terraform

For the IaC enthusiasts.

[Terraform Up and Running](https://www.terraformupandrunning.com/)

Gruntwork's Yevgeni's book, now in its third installment. That might be all you need if you want to read a book.

[Terraform in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/terraform-in-action)

Also nicely written and I'm putting it here as it has chapters on writing a provider, which Yevgeni's book doesn't dive into.

[YouTube channel of Anton Babenko](https://www.youtube.com/@AntonBabenkoLive)

If you're more into video content, that is the only channel you need about all things terraform in my opinion (and OpenTofu and terraform related projects..). Babenko is maintaining a whole lot of terraform modules and he covers a lot of things on his channel. Also a good way of keeping up to date on what is new in terraform land (I think I made a space pun).
