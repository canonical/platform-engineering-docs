# How to manage the team mailing-list

To register a "team user" on [snapcraft.io](https://snapcraft.io/) we have created the `platform-engineering@lists.canonical.com` mailing list.

This mailing list can be managed on [lists.canonical.com](https://lists.canonical.com/mailman3/postorius/lists/platform-engineering.lists.canonical.com/).

Owners are the team leadership.

Archives are available at [lists.canonical.com](https://lists.canonical.com/mailman3/hyperkitty/list/platform-engineering@lists.canonical.com/)

Accounts associated to this mailing list can be found in Bitwarden.
