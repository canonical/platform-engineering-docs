# Cycles in JIRA

Cycles are represented in JIRA as "versions" named after the end month of the cycle.
Version *25.04* represents the cycle from October 2024 to April 2025.

At the end of the cycle, the previous version is released and a new one is created to assign
Epics we plan to address during the next six months.

Versions and releases are visible in JIRA under the [Development section](https://warthogs.atlassian.net/projects/ISD?selectedItem=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin%3Arelease-page) in the sidebar.
