Cycle planning
==============

During cycle planning the high-level roadmap for 6 months is defined. This is
done towards the end of a given cycle in preparation for the next cycle. Input
comes from the team, management, and external stakeholders such as IS. Items
should be grouped by charm. Items are estimated with the engineers to establish
the number of days required to deliver an item to ensure that we donâ€™t commit
too much during a cycle. When calculating the capacity for the cycle, use the
following rough formula:

* Number of available engineers: number at the start of the cycle + expected
  hires during the cycle * 0.5
* Estimate the number of available weeks based on the length of the cycle and
  subtract any global events such as sprints and holidays such as the end of
  year shutdown
* Reserve 20% of time for management, training, hiring, leave, public holidays
* Reserve 20% for bugs and production support

Items are prioritised by management with input from the team and external
stakeholders. Each item on the roadmap becomes an epic for the cycle with
individual stories breaking down the epic to be created by engineers and
reviewed by management. The epic should include clear requirements to explain
what is needed. This can best be facilitated by a kick-off meeting to ensure
everyone understands the scope for what is needed. This is to be done during the
engineering sprint or shortly thereafter. More guidance on sprint preparation:
