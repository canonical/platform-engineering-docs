End of Day Digest
-----------------

At the end of each day, add a post to the
`EOD Digest discourse topic <https://discourse.canonical.com/t/eod-digest/2098>`_.
In order to receive notifications on new comments on the EOD discourse topic,
turn on alerts for new topics on
`this filter <https://discourse.canonical.com/tags/c/engineering/is-devops/44/eod>`_.

Guidance on what to include in the digest:

* Significant PRs you have raised or updated requiring a review from the team.
  Include some information about the purpose of the PR, what has changed and a
  link to the PR. Note that the team already has notifications for PRs in place,
  if the PR is trivial or all you are intending is to request a review, rely on
  other channels such as mattermost or the automated notifications.
* Something you struggled with, but then discovered the answer to (maybe someone
  else is struggling with the same thing, or can learn something based on what
  you mention).
* Something you are struggling with and need help with (maybe someone has come
  across something similar).
* Something interesting you learnt.
* Any documents created or updated (e.g., specifications).
* Any documents you read that might be interesting to others on the team.

Guidance on what not to include in the digest:

* Meetings (it may be interesting to include a summary of what happened during a
  meeting)
* PRs you have reviewed (unless you want to highlight something)
* Hiring activities (interviews, reviewing candidate submissions)
* Internal training
* Activities part of your development plan unless you explicitly find something
  interesting or worth sharing with the rest of the team
