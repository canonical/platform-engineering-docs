During Pulse
============

Stand up
--------

Each day during the pulse a stand up should be held. Engineers should discuss
what they were working on before and what is next, let the manager know if they
donâ€™t have sufficient work to be going on with and discuss any blockers for
resolution. It is also a chance to discuss any technical challenges potentially
after each engineer has given their regular update.

There should be a standup scheduled for each timezone the team operates in.
There will be projects being worked on across different time zones. The
`Standup Project Allocations <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Gz0Owj7h_DzFCDz7g6-mU-VA9smer_DJPDKffMtnMfU/edit?usp=sharing>`_
defines which projects are discussed at a specific stand up and who should come
to a given standup. Engineers must attend the stand up they have been allocated
and give their update and are welcome to attend any other stand up as well. The
project allocations to stand ups will be done to find a best match to ensure
that everyone working on a project is in the same stand up. The stand up times
will be adjusted on a best effort basis to accommodate engineers being able to
attend and DST changes.

End of Day Digest
-----------------

At the end of each day, add a post to the
`EOD Digest discourse topic <https://discourse.canonical.com/t/eod-digest/2098>`_.
In order to receive notifications on new comments on the EOD discourse topic,
turn on alerts for new topics on
`this filter <https://discourse.canonical.com/tags/c/engineering/is-devops/44/eod>`_.

Guidance on what to include in the digest:

* Significant PRs you have raised or updated requiring a review from the team.
  Include some information about the purpose of the PR, what has changed and a
  link to the PR. Note that the team already has notifications for PRs in place;
  if the PR is trivial or all you are intending is to request a review, rely on
  other channels such as Mattermost or the automated notifications.
* Something you struggled with, but then discovered the answer to (maybe someone
  else is struggling with the same thing, or can learn something based on what
  you mention).
* Something you are struggling with and need help with (maybe someone has come
  across something similar).
* Something interesting you learnt.
* Any documents created or updated (e.g., specifications).
* Any documents you read that might be interesting to others on the team.

Guidance on what not to include in the digest:

* Meetings (it may be interesting to include a summary of what happened during a
  meeting)
* PRs you have reviewed (unless you want to highlight something)
* Hiring activities (interviews, reviewing candidate submissions)
* Internal training
* Activities part of your development plan unless you explicitly find something
  interesting or worth sharing with the rest of the team
