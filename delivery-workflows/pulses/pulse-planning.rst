Pulse planning
==============

Project meeting
---------------

For each major group of deliverables (equivalent to an objective in Jira), e.g.
a charm with significant work to be done, a per pulse project meeting should be
held. This could also be a group of charms if there isnâ€™t sufficient work for an
individual charm. During this meeting, the progress against the roadmap should
be reviewed. Any items that are taking longer than estimated for the cycle
should be carefully reviewed for whether the scope or something else needs to
change to finish the item or whether it should be delayed.

It is useful to do this as a meeting since it is an opportunity for discussing
specific items that could be challenging, assessing priorities of stories for
the next pulse, and clarifying and reviewing stories that were created. This
usually involves quite a bit of discussion which is why a synchronous meeting is
useful. This should include reviewing the plan in Jira, and creating any new
tickets that are required to be delivered and the priority of tickets should be
clear after the meeting.

Engineers should come prepared to this meeting with the required stories
created.
