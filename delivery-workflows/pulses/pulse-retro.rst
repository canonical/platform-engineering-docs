Pulse retros
============

Towards the end of each pulse a retrospective should be held where the pulse
statement is reviewed for the result of each of the items that was intended for
the pulse which should be prepared in advance by the engineers, if not already
done during a project meeting. This should be done on the pulse statement as
discussed in ISD073 - Written Pulse Statements (to be updated).

Additionally, the retro should be used as an opportunity to get feedback on team
processes, external blockers, recognise achievements in the cycle, and discuss
any challenges the team is facing in general. This should also be prepared in
advance by everyone in the team using
`Team Improvement Ideas <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S-YjcjWic1xZ9uPLvXNNY8mMCYtsZ3OTtohpZsQlVGA/edit?usp=sharing>`_.
The ideas in this document should be reviewed and any new or in-progress items
discussed.
