Pulse retros
============

Towards the end of each pulse a retrospective should be held where the pulse is
reviewed.

Additionally, the retro should be used as an opportunity to get feedback on team
processes, external blockers, recognize achievements in the cycle, and discuss
any challenges the team is facing in general. This should also be prepared in
advance by everyone in the team using
`Team Improvement Ideas <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S-YjcjWic1xZ9uPLvXNNY8mMCYtsZ3OTtohpZsQlVGA/edit?usp=sharing>`_.
The ideas in this document should be reviewed and any new or in-progress items
discussed.
